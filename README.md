# Working-StargateMk2-with-historical-chronology
This project is inspired by the prototype of danclarke and I added the chronology where you save the coordinates typed with vision of the symbols, the place (in case of recognition with the films / tv series of the stargate) and finally the time of request of that address.

Warning: Do not attempt this build if you don't have a rudimentary understanding of electronics and Linux. This build involves surface-mount soldering, updating of Python files, and basic configuration of Linux via command line. There is no GUI.

to carry out this project you need:

Raspberry Pi 3
Adafruit Motor Hat
Adafruit I2S 3W Breakout
Custom PCB with associated components
2.5 "Speaker
12V DC Adapter

I suggest you take them in the following sites all (I leave the links of the pieces that I have taken so I facilitate the search):
