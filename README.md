# Working-StargateMk2-with-historical-chronology
the link that I leave takes you to the danclarke github where you can see how it is mounted ... the files take the ones that are here which are the ones updated with the history
https://github.com/danclarke/WorkingStargateMk2Raspi

This project is inspired by the prototype of danclarke and I added the chronology where you save the coordinates typed with vision of the symbols, the place (in case of recognition with the films / tv series of the stargate) and finally the time of request of that address.

Warning: Do not attempt this build if you don't have a rudimentary understanding of electronics and Linux. This build involves surface-mount soldering, updating of Python files, and basic configuration of Linux via command line. There is no GUI.

I suggest you take them in the following sites all (I leave the links of the pieces that I have taken so I facilitate the search,
but if it suits you, look at other offers of that product):

To build the model you will need the 3d printer and the components of the project that I leave you here
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1603423

to attach the pieces together I used the glue for the models and the double-sided adhesive, while the points needed for the screws I suggest you take the 10mm screws after you see what to use

in these files there is also a file called "Combinazioni film/serie.pdf" so you can test the functionality of existing destinations

I recommend that you have a way to simulate a server ... I used Xampp by activating the Apache server and MySQL.
Then install Xampp.
Once installed, put the project folder inside C: / xampp / htdocs

Once you have entered the folder and you have turned on the Xampp console go to the browser and type

http://localhost/WorkingStargateMk2Raspi-master

As soon as you have linked the folder, click on the web folder and the stargate command console will open there

Before doing everything create the model of the stargate and assemble the circuit as explained in the two pages I left earlier.

Then modify the code by changing the network you have of the mobile, that is the code
http: /192.168.43.34/update and also the others 2.

To do this, use your computer and check the network that is associated with it, i.e. if you have 192.168.52.84 you must enter 192.168.52.34 in the code

the .34 is for the raspberry to communicate

also in the raspberry you have to change the ip
